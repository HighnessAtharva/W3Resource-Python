# Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100 % automatic.

# 1. Write a Python code to find the Requests module - version, licence, copyright information, author, author email, document url, title and description. 


# 2. Write a Python code to check the status code issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. Print all of the methods and attributes available to objects on successful request. 


# 3. Write a Python code to send a request to a web page, and print the response text and content. Also get the raw socket response from the server. 


# 4. Write a Python code to send a request to a web page, and print the information of headers. Also parse these values and print key-value pairs holding various information. 


# 5. Write a Python code to send a request to a web page, and print the JSON value of the response. Also print each key value of the response. 


# 6. Write a Python code to send a request to a web page and stop waiting for a response after a given number of seconds. In the event of times out of request, raise Timeout exception. 


# 7. Write a Python code to send some sort of data in the URL's query string. 


# 8. Write a Python code to send cookies to a given server and access cookies from the response of a server.
