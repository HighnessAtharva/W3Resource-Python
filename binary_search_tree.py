# 1. Write a Python program to create a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) using an array (given) elements where array elements are sorted in ascending order. 


# 2. Write a Python program to find the closest value of a given target value in a given non-empty Binary Search Tree (BST) of unique values. 


# 3. Write a Python program to check whether a given a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) or not. 

# Let a binary search tree (BST) is defined as follows:
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Example 1:
#     2
#    / \
#   1   3
# Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
# Example 2:
#     1
#    / \
#   2   3
# Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.




# 4. Write a Python program to delete a node with the given key in a given Binary search tree (BST). 
# Note: Search for a node to remove. If the node is found, delete the node.


# 5. Write a Python program to convert a given array elements to a height balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). 


# 6. Write a Python program to find the kth smallest element in a given a binary search tree.
